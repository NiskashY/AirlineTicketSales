<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM OPERATION

1. Authorization</b>

At the beginning of authorization, the program offers the user to log in, register a new account or log out (Fig. 1).

</p>

If registered, a new account will be created without access to the system. Access will be granted as soon as the administrator approves the application for a new account. If the user already has an account with access to the system, he can log in using his username and password. The hash of the password is checked against what is stored in the file and if they are the same, authorization is completed successfully.

<b>2. Admin Module</b>

The admin module includes viewing, deleting, modifying, sorting, adding account and flight information, and buying tickets, which is an individual task. (Fig. 2 - 4).
